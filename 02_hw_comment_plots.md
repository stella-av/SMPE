## Arrests vs murders

![plot1](https://github.com/stella-av/SMPE/blob/main/graph1.jpg)



### Data

### Graphical objects

-   Variables are not very well explained (what is the age range for juvenile, an for kids)
-   No grids, and few labels on the y axis for Arrests, so it is hard to estimate the exact number e.g. for 2003

### Annotations

### Information

-   the plot uses two different scales on the same y axes, so there is no comparison possible between the two categories

### Context

-   The plot has no title

### Data

### Graphical objects

-   In the second plot, the colors distinguishing age ranges cannot be told apart.

### Annotations

-   The axes are not labelled
-   The x axes of the two plots are differently represented, the first one being more confusing (numbers could be mistaken for a month instead of a year).
-   The y axes are also differently labelled, when if it is the same measure, they could be more easily compared with a shared one.
-   The infographic inside the first plot does not clearily refer to a timepoint
