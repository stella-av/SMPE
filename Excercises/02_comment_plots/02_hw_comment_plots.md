### Good graphics checklist

#### Data
- [ ] Type of graphic adapted
- [ ] Interpolation make sens
- [ ] Sufficient number of points
- [ ] Building method clear
- [ ] Confidence intervals visualized
- [ ] Appropriate steps for histograms
- [ ] Histograms visualize probabilities

#### Graphical objects
- [ ] Graphical objects are readable on any support
- [ ] Standard color range
- [ ] Axis identified and labelled
- [ ] Scales units are explicit
- [ ] No ambiguity when curves cross
- [ ] Grid helps reading

#### Annotation
- [ ] Axis are labelled by quantities
- [ ] Labels of the axis are clear, and self contained
- [ ] Units are indicated on the axis
- [ ] Axes are oriented fron bottom-left to top-right
- [ ] Origin should be (0,0), if not it should be clearly justified
- [ ] No Hole on the axes
- [ ] the order's of graph/histogram bar is based on classical ordering 
- [ ] Curves and Bar has legend

#### Information
- [ ] Curves on the same scale
- [ ] Less than 6 curves
- [ ] Compare curves on same graphics
- [ ] A curve cannot be removed without reducing infos
- [ ] The graphic gives relevant infos
- [ ] If showing average, don't forger the error bars
- [ ] It is not possible to remove object without altering readability

#### Context
- [ ] All symbols used are defined and references
- [ ] The graphics is the most appropriate representation for the data
- [ ] The graphic has a title
- [ ] The title is meaningful and self contained
- [ ] The graphic is referenced in text
- [ ] The text comment the figure







## Arrests vs murders

### Data

### Graphical objects

-   Variables are not very well explained (what is the age range for juvenile, an for kids)
-   No grids, and few labels on the y axis for Arrests, so it is hard to estimate the exact number e.g. for 2003

### Annotations

### Information

-   The plot uses two different scales on the same y axis, so there is no comparison possible between the two categories.

### Context

-   The plot has no title.




## Le chomage

### Data

### Graphical objects

-   In the second plot, the colors distinguishing age ranges cannot be told apart.

### Annotations

-   The axes are not labelled
-   The x axes of the two plots are differently represented, the first one being more confusing (numbers could be mistaken for a month instead of a year).
-   The y axes are also differently labelled, when if it is the same measure, they could be more easily compared with a shared one.
-   The infographic inside the first plot does not clearily refer to a timepoint
